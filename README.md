This is an attendance automation system using ***opencv*** and the ***facial recognition*** modules. Using a database of students faces it will be able to __correctly identify faces 90% of the time.__

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Perquisites

- [__pip3__](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
- [__Python >= 3.7.4__](https://www.python.org)
- [__Opencv__](https://opencv.org)
- [__Face Recognition__](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition)

### Installing

***Install python3 and pip3***

```
install python3
```

***Instal opencv and Face Recognition***
```
pip3 install opencv face_recognition
```

After installing all the necessary modules you can now run the script.

## Built With

* [Opencv](https://opencv.org)
* [Face Recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition)
* [Schedule](https://github.com/)
  
## The Vision
The program should be expandable so that new faces can easily be added. To simplify use, the program should be deployed on a server and let clients to connect to it for cloud computing and the clients can ask for reports at the end of the day or even mid-day.
